<h2> William van Doorn </h2>

Hey, I'm William. Currently I am a resident in clinical chemistry at the Maastricht University
Medical Center. Moreover, I love building software. 

This is my spot on the web for writing, projects, tutorials, art, and anything else I want to put out there. Check out the blog, or take a look at the projects page to see a highlight of my open-source work.

This site has no ads, no affiliate links, no tracking or analytics, no sponsored posts, and no paywall. My motivation for this site is to have a space for self-expression and to share what I've learned with the world. I hope I will inspire others to make their own creative corner on the web as well.

Feel free to contact me by email at wptmdoorn at gmail.com!
